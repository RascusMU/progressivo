# Expatriation and Visas

Expatriation, i.e., moving abroad, is an exciting life change, but it also brings a number of challenges. One of the biggest tends to be visa obligations and administrative hurdles.
**Our services include:**

**Analysis of your needs:** We will help you identify the right type of visa based on your goal – whether it is for work, study, business, or permanent residence.

**Assistance with visa applications:** We will prepare all necessary documentation, ensure its correct completion, and submit the application in accordance with the requirements of the target country.

**Legal advice:** We ensure that everything proceeds legally and according to valid regulations, while minimizing the risk of application rejection.

**Relocation services:** In addition to the visa agenda, we will help you with finding housing, insurance, opening a bank account, or recommending schools for your children.

**Long-term support:** Even after your move, we are here to help you with any legal questions or visa extensions.

**Expats from the EU and outside the EU:**
Why is consultation necessary?
Rules and requirements for expats can vary significantly depending on where you come from and where you are going. If you are an expat from the EU, you may have easier access in some countries thanks to agreements on the free movement of persons. Conversely, expats coming from outside the EU often are subject to stricter visa and immigration rules, which can be more complicated and require more detailed preparation.

Therefore, it is essential to consult your specific case with professionals like Progressivo Corp., who have detailed knowledge of the legal differences between individual countries and will guide you correctly. Thanks to our individual approach and experience, we will help you navigate these rules and find the best solution.
