# DNA Analysis

**DNA Analysis** is a modern scientific method of examining genetic information that allows you to better understand your origin, health, and predispositions.

**Sources of DNA for analysis include:**
biological samples, most commonly a buccal swab or saliva sample, making the collection painless and simple.

**DNA analysis results can reveal:**
Information about your ethnic origin and ancestors (genealogy).
Hereditary predispositions to certain diseases.
Metabolic characteristics, such as how your body processes certain foods or medications.
Innate talents and physical predispositions, for example, for sports.

**DNA Analysis** is a useful tool not only for discovering family history but also for personalized health care and lifestyle management. Everything is conducted with an emphasis on privacy and the security of your genetic data.
