## Privacy Policy

**Data Controller:**
Progressivo Corp
Registered office: Obrnice 227, 435 21 Obrnice, Czech Republic
E-mail: info@progressivo.eu

Protecting your privacy is our priority. Our website is designed to collect only the absolute minimum amount of data necessary for its operation and communication with you.

### 1. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

**Our website does not use any analytics or marketing cookies.**
We do not track your online behavior, create user profiles, or pass data to advertising networks. For this reason, you will not find an annoying consent banner (cookie banner) on our website.

**Technical Storage (LocalStorage):**
To ensure user comfort, we use your browser's technical storage (so-called LocalStorage). Only your website preference settings are stored here:
*   Language selection (so we can display the website in the correct language).
*   Light/Dark mode setting.

This data does not leave your browser and is used exclusively for the technical functionality of the website.

### 2. Google Maps

We use the Google Maps service to display our location.
*   **No automatic loading:** The map is disabled by default to prevent data transfer to Google without your knowledge.
*   **Click-to-activate:** The map loads only when you actively click on it.
*   After activating the map, Google may process your data (e.g., IP address) and store third-party cookies according to its own privacy policy.

### 3. Contact Form

If you contact us via the form on the website, we process the data you enter (name, e-mail, message text).

*   **Purpose of processing:** This data is used exclusively to process your inquiry, respond to your request, or for pre-contractual negotiations.
*   **No marketing:** We do not use your contact details to send unsolicited commercial communications (newsletters) and do not pass them on to third parties for marketing purposes.

### 4. Your Rights

In accordance with GDPR, you have the right to request access to your personal data, its correction, deletion, or restriction of processing. You can direct your questions or requests to the e-mail info@progressivo.eu.
