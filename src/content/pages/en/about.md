About Us

## How We Started and How We Are Growing

**Progressivo Corp.** came into existence in 2022 in the capital city of Panama. In the heart of this Central American country, strategically located at the crossroads of world trade routes, an ambitious project was born: a plan to establish a group of international experts with rich experience from the European logistics sector.

Despite its relatively young age, the company managed to work its way up among the leading players in the field of international trade with heavy machinery in just three years. This remarkable rise was not a matter of chance, but the result of a thoughtful strategy that combines deep industry knowledge with innovative approaches to international trade management.

**European Expertise as the Foundation of Success**
The key factor behind the rapid rise of Progressivo Corp. is undoubtedly more than 15 years of accumulated experience of our leadership team in the European market. This expertise, gained in the demanding environment of European logistics, brings invaluable know-how to the Panamanian company.

Our founder and CEO, Jaroslav Cingel, worked for over a decade as a logistics strategist for several leading European companies specializing in heavy machinery. Under his leadership, an expert team was formed, composed of professionals with rich experience from various European markets – from German precision to Italian flexibility to Scandinavian efficiency.

This diversity of perspectives and experiences allows us to perfectly understand the specific needs of clients from different cultural and business environments. Thanks to this, we can offer solutions that are truly made to measure.

**Bridge Between Continents**
In today's globalized world, the ability to effectively connect different regions is a key competitive advantage. Progressivo Corp. has strategically positioned itself as a bridge between European and non-European markets, allowing us to ensure a smooth flow of goods and services across continents.

Our headquarters in Panama represents an ideal starting point for serving the American continent, while our European office in Prague ensures smooth communication with European partners and clients. In addition, we have a network of logistics hubs in key ports of South America, Asia, and Africa.

This strategic presence allows us to overcome typical obstacles of international trade, such as customs complications, different regulatory requirements, or logistical challenges. For our clients, this means faster, more reliable, and cost-effective deliveries of heavy machinery and related services.

**Comprehensive Ecosystem of Services**
Progressivo Corp. has long crossed the boundaries of a mere trader with heavy machinery. Our vision lies in providing a comprehensive ecosystem of services that cover the entire life cycle of a business relationship.

Thanks to Progressivo Corp., I managed to expand quickly to the international market and open doors to new business opportunities.
