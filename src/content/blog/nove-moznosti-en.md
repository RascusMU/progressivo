### DNA Analysis

What is DNA analysis actually?

**DNA Analysis** is a modern process that allows you to look deep into your genetic code to reveal information about your origin, ethnic roots, health predispositions, and family ties. This process is usually performed using a saliva sample or cells from the oral cavity, which is sent to a specialized laboratory for analysis.

The results can provide you with a unique view of your family history, help you understand your hereditary traits, and even connect you with relatives you might not have known about.
**Why should you want DNA analysis?**

1. **Knowing your origin and ethnic roots:** DNA analysis can determine where your ancestors came from and uncover your ethnic composition. You may find that you have roots in unexpected parts of the world, allowing you to better understand your own identity and family history.

2. **Connecting with relatives:** DNA testing can help you find distant relatives who share part of your genetic information. Thanks to this, you can connect with people who are directly linked to your family, even if they live on the other side of the planet.

3. **Health insights:** Some DNA tests also offer information about your genetic predispositions to certain diseases or health conditions. This can help you take better care of your health and take preventive measures.

4. **Enriching personal family stories:** DNA analysis can provide important data for creating a detailed family history and help you find answers to questions about your ancestors and their life stories.

5. **Education and inspiration:** Knowledge of your own origin can be not only fascinating but also inspiring. It can motivate you to further explore your family's history and culture.

**How can Progressivo Corp. help you with this?**

### Expatriation and Visas

What do expatriation and visas have in common?

**Expatriation and Visas:** The key to your new life abroad.

**Moving abroad** – whether for work, study, or a better lifestyle – is an exciting but also challenging life change. This process, known as **expatriation**, brings not only the opportunity to discover new cultures but also many questions and obstacles.
One of the most important parts of this process is obtaining the right type of visa that allows you to legally live, work, or study in a new country.
Every country has its own visa systems and requirements, which can be complex and often confusing – from work and student visas to investor or family visas.

Successful expatriation, however, begins with a correct understanding of these rules and their precise fulfillment. If you plan to start your new life chapter abroad, it is important to have a reliable partner who will guide you through this process.

**How can Progressivo Corp. help you?**
Progressivo Corp. is an expert in ensuring the smooth course of **expatriation and visa agenda**. Thanks to our experience with international relocations and legal requirements in various countries, we help our clients overcome all administrative obstacles.
 **Our services include:**

**Analysis of your needs:** We will help you identify the right type of visa based on your goal – whether it is work, study, business, or permanent residence.

**Assistance with visa applications:** We will prepare all necessary documentation, ensure its correct completion, and submit the application in accordance with the requirements of the destination country.

**Legal advice:** We will ensure that everything proceeds legally and according to valid regulations, while minimizing the risk of application rejection.

**Relocation services:** In addition to the visa agenda, we will help you with finding housing, insurance, opening a bank account, or recommend schools for your children.

**Long-term support:** Even after your move, we are here to help you with any legal questions or visa extensions.

**Expats from EU and non-EU:**
Why is consultation necessary?
Rules and requirements for expats can vary significantly depending on where you come from and where you are going. If you are an EU expatriate, you may have easier access in some countries thanks to agreements on the free movement of persons. Conversely, expats coming from outside the EU are often subject to stricter visa and immigration rules, which can be more complicated and require more detailed preparation.

Therefore, it is essential to consult your specific case with professionals like Progressivo Corp., who have detailed knowledge of legal differences between individual countries and will direct you correctly. Thanks to our individual approach and experience, we will help you navigate these rules and find the best solution.
