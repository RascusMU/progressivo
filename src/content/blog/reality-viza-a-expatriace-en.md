## New Beginning in Europe: An Opportunity That Can Change Your Life

Europe is a place where you can start over, live by your own rules, and discover a sense of true home. Even seemingly impossible conditions are not a problem for Progressivo Corp. – even if you come from non-EU countries such as Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Moldova, or Kazakhstan. Contact us and step towards a better future!"

Living abroad means getting a chance for a new beginning – space for change, growth, and achieving dreams. But what path leads to this goal? How to handle administrative requirements, obtain a visa, and become part of the dynamic European environment? The truth is that for people outside the EU, processes can be more complex, but this is where **Progressivo Corp.** comes in, offering you a unique solution. Europe still has a high demand for skilled workers from all possible sectors – from information technology through healthcare to construction. With us, this path is easier.

***Chapter 1: Why Europe?***

Europe is not just a continent full of history and culture. For many people from countries such as Kazakhstan, Ukraine, or Georgia, it is a symbol of safety, stability, and opportunities for a better life. Why do so many people choose Europe? The answer is simple: Europe offers a chance for a better future.
Whether it is access to modern services, a favorable labor market, or the possibility to ensure quality living conditions for your family, Europe has something to offer. For example, Germany, one of the most developed EU countries, has such a high demand for experts that it creates special programs to attract qualified workers from abroad. Similarly, Poland and the Czech Republic, thanks to their geographical proximity to Eastern Europe, offer simplified procedures for employing workers from these regions.
**Progressivo Corp.** will help you not only choose the right country for your needs but also guide you through administrative processes such as obtaining a work permit, visa, or recognition of qualifications. Imagine coming to a country where work in your profession is not only available but also well paid. Where your skills are warmly welcomed and where you can grow professionally and personally.

***Chapter 2: What Can Europe Offer You?***

Life in Europe has many advantages that can fundamentally change your future.
Among the most significant are:
 **Higher income**: In European countries, you can earn several times more than in your home country. For example, a doctor in Germany can have an average salary up to ten times higher than a doctor in Kazakhstan.
 **Quality healthcare**: European healthcare is among the best in the world. Your family will gain access to modern medical care, which is often available even for foreigners.
 **Stability and legal certainties**: The European Union is known for its emphasis on human rights, equality, and protection of social security. **Progressivo Corp.** will help you secure all necessary documents so you can take advantage of these benefits.
 **Quality education for children**: Your children can study at prestigious schools and universities that will open doors to an international career for them.
**Freedom of travel**:
With a visa or work permit, you can travel freely throughout Europe. Imagine spending one weekend in Rome, another in Paris, and celebrating Christmas in Vienna.

***Chapter 3: What Challenges Await You?***

Every beginning brings certain challenges. If you come from countries like Belarus, Kazakhstan, or Armenia, you may encounter more complex administrative processes. It will be necessary to obtain a work permit, visa, prove your qualifications, or prepare for language requirements. However, **Progressivo Corp.** will handle all of this for you – we will help you go through the entire process quickly and easily.
Many European countries realize how valuable qualified workers from Eastern Europe are and therefore try to simplify processes. For example, Poland and the Czech Republic offer faster procedures for workers from Ukraine or Belarus. Germany has special programs for health workers, while the Netherlands attracts experts in technical fields.

***Chapter 4: How to Start Your Journey?***

The beginning is always the hardest, but also the most important part of any change. First, clarify what you expect from life in Europe. Do you want to earn money and return back, or do you long for permanent settlement?
**Progressivo Corp.** will help you with all practical steps – from gathering necessary information about visas and work permits to arranging language courses or recognition of your qualifications. With our help, you will be sure that you won't forget anything.

***Chapter 5: What Could Your New Life Look Like?***

Imagine settling in a quiet neighborhood of Munich, walking along Amsterdam's canals, or enjoying the atmosphere of historic Prague. Your children go to a quality school, you work in a field that fulfills you, and you know that your skills are valued. **Progressivo Corp.** is your partner on this journey and will help you achieve your goals.

***Chapter 6: Are You Ready for Change?***

Change can be challenging, but opportunity lies within it. If you long for a better life for yourself and your loved ones, maybe now is the right time to take the first step. With the help of **Progressivo Corp.**, there is no obstacle that could stop you – whether you come from Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, or other non-EU countries.
Start your journey today. **Progressivo Corp.** is here to support you at every step towards your new life in Europe. Your new beginning starts right now!

## Connect with Progressivo Corp. and Discover a New Lifestyle in the Heart of Central and South America

How Progressivo Corp. helps expats.

**Facilitating Life in Central and South America Including Legal Assistance, Visas, and Work Permits**

Are you considering a new beginning in Central or South America? Whether you are attracted by the tropical climate of Panama, the hospitality of Colombia, or the **"Pura Vida"** philosophy in Costa Rica, moving to a new country can be exciting but also full of challenges. That is why Progressivo Corp. is here, a company founded by Jaroslav, also known as Rascus, which is determined to help you with a smooth transition to a new life stage.

Progressivo Corp. understands that not only finding housing or getting used to a new culture, but also legal questions, visas, and work permits can be complicated for many expats. Thanks to extensive experience and local contacts, Progressivo Corp. provides comprehensive support in these key areas.

**Assistance with Visa Policy and Work Permits**

One of the biggest problems when relocating abroad is obtaining the right type of visa or work permit. Legal and administrative requirements vary in individual countries, but Progressivo Corp. has experience in guiding you safely through the process in Panama, Colombia, and Costa Rica.

**Visa Support:**

Whether it is a tourist visa, long-term residence visa, or special visas for investors or self-employed persons, Progressivo Corp. will help you choose the best option and handle the entire application process. For example, Panama offers an attractive program for expats called "Friendly Nations Visa", which allows easier acquisition of long-term residence.

**Work Permits:**

If you plan to work in the new country, Progressivo Corp. will advise you on how to obtain a work permit in accordance with local laws. Each country has its own requirements, but Progressivo Corp. will ensure that all documents are in order and the process runs as smoothly as possible.

**Legal Assistance and Administrative Support.**

Relocation to a foreign country brings a whole range of legal questions, whether it is buying real estate, starting a business, or negotiating employment contracts. Progressivo Corp. cooperates with local lawyers and experts who will help you solve all legal requirements.

Buying or renting real estate: Progressivo Corp. will guide you through the entire process, from finding the ideal property to signing the contract. In countries like Panama or Colombia, processes are often simpler than in Europe, but require local knowledge of laws, which Progressivo Corp. provides.

**Support in Starting a Company:**

If you plan to do business, Progressivo Corp. will help you with everything from company registration to tax obligations. Panama and Costa Rica are known for their favorable environment for entrepreneurs.

**Other Legal Services:**
Whether it is document translation, advice on local legislation, or assistance in solving unexpected situations, you can rely on Jaroslav standing by your side.

**Why is Progressivo Corp. the ideal partner for expats?**
The company founder, Jaroslav – Rascus, not only experienced the transition to Latin America himself with his entire family, who always supported him on this complex life journey, but also deeply understands the needs of expats thanks to his personal experiences and travels around Latin America.

Progressivo Corp. focuses not only on technical and legal aspects but also on a human approach and understanding your individual needs.

***"Moving to a new country is not just about papers and documents, but about creating a home and a feeling that you belong somewhere. Progressivo Corp. will help you not only with everything practical but also to make you feel truly welcome,"*** says Jaroslav.

**Why is life in Panama, Colombia, and Costa Rica easier than in Europe?**

Central and South America offer not only lower living costs but also simpler bureaucracy and a friendly approach from authorities. In countries like Germany, France, or Sweden, expats are often discouraged by the complexity of processes associated with bureaucracy.
Conversely, in Panama, Colombia, and Costa Rica, administration is less demanding and officials tend to be more willing.
Moreover, these countries provide expats with the opportunity to live more comfortably and cheaply. For example:
Renting an apartment in Panama City can cost around 500–800 USD, while in Paris or London, a similar apartment would cost even 2000 EUR per month.

C**olombia offers excellent healthcare for a fraction of the price of European systems.**

Costa Rica is known for its low crime rate and high stability, making it an ideal place for families.

**Lifestyle of Local Residents: Inspiration for a New Beginning**

One of the main advantages of living in these countries is the approach of local residents to life. Panamanians, Colombians, and Costa Ricans value simple joys – meeting family and friends, good food, music, and nature. They do not chase wealth and careers but enjoy every day.

In Panama, locals enjoy evenings barbecuing, sunsets on the beach, or quiet moments in the mountains.

Colombia is a country where dance and social events play an important role – every weekend is a celebration of life.

In Costa Rica, "Pura Vida" is not just a philosophy but a way of life that teaches you to slow down and appreciate every moment.

***If you dream of a new life full of joy, well-being, and lower costs, Progressivo Corp. is ready to guide you through every step of the journey. From visas and work permits to legal assistance and counseling – let experts help you, who believe that life is about connecting people, cultures, and opportunities. As Jaroslav says: "Progressivo Corp. is not just a company, it is your partner on the way to a better future."***

## Real Estate in Tropical Paradise: Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia

**Costa Rica**

**Costa Rica: A Land Where the Heart Sings and Nature Embraces**.

Costa Rica is like a postcard coming to life. A country where the jungle meets the ocean, where volcanoes silently watch over the landscape, and where the philosophy of **"Pura Vida",** meaning "pure life", becomes an everyday reality. It is a place where time stops – and suddenly you find that things that used to stress you out are suddenly completely irrelevant.

But there is a question that might trouble you – is Costa Rica really the best place to live.

**Let's answer that:**
Breathtaking nature that inspires
Costa Rica is undoubtedly a paradise for nature lovers. Volcanoes like Arenal or Poás, tropical rainforests full of exotic animals and plants, endless beaches on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts – all this makes this small country a huge natural gem. Sloths in trees, monkeys frolicking on branches, colorful toucans, and butterflies the size of your palm – nature literally breathes life here.

If you are looking for a place where you can escape from the busy world, Costa Rica is the perfect choice. But here Panama is starting to catch up slightly with Costa Rica.

**Why?**
Because Panama offers not only natural beauties (for example, tropical archipelagos like Bocas del Toro or San Blas) but also modern and easier-to-reach infrastructure.

Costa Rica is synonymous with peace. The pace of life here flows more slowly, and that is exactly what attracts most people here. But if you are looking for a combination of natural well-being and city life, Panama has a head start.
Panama City, the cosmopolitan heart of the country, is a modern metropolis with skyscrapers, top restaurants, first-class shops, and nightlife.
Costa Rica, on the other hand, offers smaller towns that have their charm but lack the dynamics and possibilities of a big city.

One of the things where Panama surpasses Costa Rica is infrastructure. Panama has more modern roads, airports, and healthcare, which is often compared to the best world standards. Moreover, Panama is an international trade hub thanks to its canal, which attracts investors from all over the world.

Costa Rica, on the other hand, bet on nature protection, which is beautiful, but sometimes it means compromises when it comes to infrastructure and services. Small remote areas may be less accessible and modern technologies are not always within reach. So if you plan a life where technology and comfort play an important role, Panama is one step ahead.

If you are looking for a place where you could invest in real estate, Panama has better conditions. Its market is very friendly to foreign investors and offers benefits such as tax breaks and special visas for retirees, which include discounts on healthcare, travel, and other services. Real estate prices in Panama are still competitive but also have the potential for rapid growth due to increasing demand.

Costa Rica also offers interesting opportunities, but its market is less developed and real estate prices may be higher in some areas because demand already exceeds supply. In addition, it is necessary to reckon with the fact that the process of buying real estate in Costa Rica can be more complex and less transparent than in Panama.

**So what is better?**

Both countries have their charm and it depends on what you are looking for. If you long for a quiet life surrounded by nature, where time stops and your soul finds peace, Costa Rica is your choice. It is a country that will show you how to take a deep breath and truly live.
But if you want a dynamic lifestyle, modern infrastructure, easy access to global markets, and at the same time the possibility of a quick escape to a tropical paradise, Panama will thrill you.
Moreover, Panama offers better conditions for investors and expats looking for a safe and prosperous place to live.

So come with Progressivo Corp. for your new home in the tropics?

Whether you are attracted by the quiet nature of Costa Rica or the modern dynamics of Panama, Progressivo Corp. will help you find exactly what you are looking for. Our experts will ensure a smooth process of buying property, legal support, and all the information you need to live in these amazing countries.

So what do you say? Will you stop dreaming and start your new life in paradise? But hurry up – sloths in Costa Rica and beaches in Panama are already waiting for you! 😊

**Panama**

**Gateway Between Worlds and Land of Endless Possibilities**

If Panama had a resume, it would certainly boast the sentence: "***I connect two continents and on top of that I have my own canal!***" This small but incredibly significant country on the world map occupies a strategic position that makes it one of the most important links between North and South America. Its famous Panama Canal is literally the artery of world trade – and let's face it, few can say they have a canal at home through which thousands of ships pass annually. **Panama is simply the boss.**

But don't be fooled by its business seriousness. Panama is not just about the canal and economy – it is also a country that lets you experience the world like on a swing. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wake up in a luxury apartment with a view of the Pacific Ocean and enjoy the sunset over the Caribbean Sea in the evening? In Panama, this is no dream – this is everyday reality. Just choose which side you want to look at.

**Panama City:**
**A Cosmopolitan Metropolis Where Dreams Come True**.

If you like the hustle and bustle of a big city, Panama City will thrill you. This city is like a mix of New York and a tropical paradise – skyscrapers, modern infrastructure, top restaurants, shops, nightlife, and yet a short distance away you will find beaches where time flows more slowly. What more could you wish for? Panama City is an ideal place for those who want to live in the center of events but at the same time have the opportunity to easily escape to peace.

For anyone thinking about investing in real estate, Panama City is a gold mine. You can buy a luxury apartment in one of the modern skyscrapers with a view that will take your breath away.
 And if you need another convincing argument – in Panama, you will also find the "Trump Tower". So when someone visits you, you can jokingly say: "I live just a bit away from Trump!" (And then laugh because you know it's kind of true.)

**Beaches, Islands, and Caribbean Paradise**

And now imagine deciding to exchange the city hustle for the peace of a tropical paradise for a while. Panama has more than 1500 islands, so if you wanted to visit one every day, it would take you over four years – and that's quite a challenge! The most famous places are for example Bocas del Toro or the San Blas archipelago, where white beaches, palms, and a sea so clear that you would see even lost sunscreen on the bottom will welcome you.

If you like Robinson Crusoe but don't want to be completely cut off from the world, then Panama is your ideal variant. Here you can enjoy peace without having to wait for castaway rescue. And moreover, local residents, known as Kuna Indians, will teach you how to make traditional colorful fabrics or catch fish in the "catch and eat" style.

**Opportunity for Adventurers and Investors**

Panama is a country of endless possibilities. Do you want to start a business, invest in real estate, or just looking for a new home where modern lifestyle combines with tropical comfort? Here you have everything. The Panamanian government supports foreign investors, offers low taxes and even special visas for retirees, which include discounts on transport, healthcare, or perhaps a movie ticket. You will feel that Panama welcomes you with open arms – and maybe even with a coconut drink in hand.

Just imagine living in a villa surrounded by palms, where exotic birds welcome you every morning with their singing and right behind the house you have a beach that looks like from a catalog. And if you get a taste for a bit of city life, in a few hours you are back in Panama City and enjoying world restaurants or nightlife.

**Why Panama? Because it is a country impossible to resist**.

Panama is not just a country, it is an experience. It is a place where old traditions and the modern world exist side by side in perfect harmony. Whether you are attracted by luxury city life, a quiet beach environment, or the opportunity to invest in a growing real estate market, Panama will never disappoint you. Moreover, who wouldn't want to live in a country that has its own canal and where coffee tastes so good that it forces you to buy a kilo for the trip home right away?

**With Progressivo Corp. you can embark on this amazing journey without worries. Our experts will help you find the ideal property, arrange all legal matters, and advise you on how to really settle in Panama. And now stop hesitating, because if you don't seize the opportunity to discover Panama, it might happen to you that your neighbor beats you to it one day – and you don't want that, do you? 😊**

**Colombia**

Welcome to Colombia, the pearl of South America, which will enchant you at first sight with its diversity. This country, located in the north of South America, is like a small continent in itself.

**Landscape That Takes You on a Dream Journey**

Colombia is a country of contrasts. In the north, white Caribbean beaches await you, where you can swim in the clear sea and relax under palms. In the west, you will find the rugged Pacific Ocean with wild nature and surfer bays. In the center of the country, in the heart of the Andes, green hills of coffee plantations and mountain towns are hidden, where an authentic Colombian atmosphere breathes on you.
If you like adventure, you can head to the Amazon rainforest, where lush jungle, exotic animals, and the culture of indigenous people will surround you. And for those who long for breathtaking views, we recommend a trip to the snowy peaks of the Andes. Colombia will simply surprise you at every step – and it doesn't matter if you decide to relax on the beach or hike to a mountain peak.

**History, Culture, and Charm That Cannot Be Imitated**

Colombia is not only a country of natural beauties but also a place of rich history and culture. Cities like **Cartagena** will enchant you with their colorful colonial streets and fortresses that guarded the city against pirates. Walk along the cobblestones, taste fresh fruit from a smiling saleswoman in a traditional costume, and watch history come to life around every corner.
If you are looking for a more modern atmosphere, then head to **Medellín**, the city of eternal spring, which transformed from the gloomy 80s into one of the most modern and inspiring cities in Latin America. Medellín is a city of innovation, art, and life – whether you ride futuristic cable cars connecting all parts of the city or visit local art galleries, you will always have something to admire.
And we must not forget the capital **Bogotá**, which is a mix of history, modern architecture, and pulsating nightlife. Visit the legendary Gold Museum, taste traditional Colombian dishes, and let yourself be carried away by salsa rhythms in one of the local clubs. Colombia will teach you that here every day life is celebrated.

**Colombian Coffee: Drink of the Gods (and Every One of You)**

If you are a coffee lover, prepare for heaven on earth. Colombia is one of the largest coffee producers in the world and its coffee plantations belong to the most picturesque places you can visit. Head to the **Eje Cafetero** region and experience how coffee is grown, harvested, and processed. And what is best? Every sip will convince you that there is no better coffee in the world than Colombian.

Real Estate: Your Dream of a Home in Tropical Paradise

Colombia is also a great destination if you are thinking about buying a property.

Colombia is an ideal place for those looking for a quiet home but at the same time longing for adventure and cultural enrichment.

**Why Colombia? Because Here Everyone Finds Their Piece of Paradise**
Colombia is a country that will enchant you with its diversity, energy, and human warmth.

### Summary: Colombia vs. Costa Rica vs. Panama

Each of these countries is unique and offers a completely different lifestyle. Your choice depends on what you expect from life in a tropical paradise, what your priorities are, and what appeals to you the most. Let's look in more detail at what each of these destinations offers.

**Colombia: Adventure, Culture, and Affordability**

Colombia is a country bursting with life and contrasts.
On one hand, it offers beautiful nature, from Caribbean beaches through the Andes mountains to the Amazon rainforest, and on the other hand, vibrant cities full of history and culture.
Colombia is ideal for those looking for an authentic South American experience. It is a country where local hospitality warms your heart and where you discover something new at every step. History and architecture lovers will appreciate colonial pearls like Cartagena, while modern nomads will be thrilled by Medellín with its progressiveness and dynamics.
A big advantage of Colombia is its relatively low living costs and affordable real estate prices, which makes it an attractive destination for both expats and investors. If you are looking for a place where you can experience authentic South America to the fullest, discover fascinating culture, taste world-famous coffee, and at the same time live at an affordable price, Colombia is the right choice.

**Costa Rica: Peace, Harmony, and Natural Paradise**

Costa Rica is synonymous with peace and life in harmony with nature. This small Central American country will teach you the philosophy of "Pura Vida" or "Pure Life".

Costa Rica is ideal for nature lovers. Volcanoes, rainforests, waterfalls, endless beaches, and rich biodiversity – all this is within reach. In the morning you can surf on Pacific waves, in the afternoon walk through a tropical forest, and in the evening relax in thermal springs.

**Panama: Modern Paradise with Economic Benefits**

Panama City, the pulsating capital, offers everything – from luxury real estate through first-class restaurants to busy nightlife.
A key benefit of Panama is its modern infrastructure and economic stability. Thanks to the Panama Canal, the country is one of the most important trade centers in the world. Panama also offers great benefits for foreign investors and expats – tax breaks, visas for retirees, and low living costs compared to many Western countries.
In addition, Panama is strategically located. You can fly from the Caribbean coast to the Pacific coast in a few hours or go to relax in the tropical archipelago of San Blas or Bocas del Toro. Panama is a great choice for those who want to combine the comfort of the modern world with a tropical paradise.

**How to Choose?**

**Colombia:** If you long for an authentic South American experience, love adventure, rich culture, diverse nature, and appreciate affordable housing, Colombia is ideal for you.
