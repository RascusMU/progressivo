17:39:26 [@astrojs/cloudflare] Enabling sessions with Cloudflare KV with the "SESSION" KV binding.
17:39:26 [@astrojs/cloudflare] If you see the error "Invalid binding `SESSION`" in your build output, you need to add the binding to your wrangler config file.
17:39:27 [WARN] [adapter] Cloudflare does not support sharp at runtime. However, you can configure `imageService: "compile"` to optimize images with sharp on prerendered pages during build time.
[preview] The @astrojs/cloudflare adapter does not support the preview command.
